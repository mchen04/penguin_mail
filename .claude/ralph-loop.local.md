Fix these issues - First, the compose window and search mail input dont have enough spacing and they touch the borders around them so add proper padding and margin. Second, increase the mock email data to have enough conversations to test pagination with at least 50 emails. Third, make the first 5 emails have reply threads so we can see how the reply chain UI looks.
