Fix these issues - First, reduce the HEIGHT of the compose window header bar and the search bar as they are too tall and need to be more compact. Second, ensure the mock email data shows at least 50 conversations in the inbox for pagination testing. Third, make sure the first 5 emails have reply threads so we can see how the reply chain UI looks.
